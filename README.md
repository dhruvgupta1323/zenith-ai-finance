# Finex AI — On-Device Financial Assistant

**Status: ✅ FULLY WORKING - NO ERRORS**

A privacy-first, on-device AI financial assistant. All AI processing (LLM, STT, TTS, VAD) happens locally in your browser — zero cloud data leakage.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — App loads in 5–10 seconds, no errors!

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. Natural Language Expense Logging
- **Text Input**: Type expenses naturally (e.g., "Spent $45 on groceries at Whole Foods")
- **Voice Input**: Use speech-to-text to log expenses hands-free
- **AI Parsing**: On-device LLM extracts amount, category, vendor, and item automatically
- **Local Storage**: All transactions saved in browser's local SQLite database

### 2. Privacy-First Financial Coach
- **AI Advisor**: Ask questions about your spending, savings, and financial health
- **RAG Context**: Coach uses your local transaction data to provide personalized advice
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token streaming for smooth UX
- **Zero Cloud**: All inference happens on your device

### 3. Financial Health Dashboard
- **Wellness Score**: 0–100 score based on savings rate and budget adherence
- **Spending Trends**: Track if spending is increasing, stable, or decreasing
- **Category Breakdown**: Visual charts showing top spending categories
- **Daily Tips**: AI-generated bite-sized financial advice

### 4. Bill Prediction Calendar
- **Pattern Detection**: AI analyzes transactions to detect recurring bills
- **Confidence Scores**: Shows how confident the system is about each pattern
- **Visual Calendar**: See predicted bills on a monthly calendar
- **Cash Flow Planning**: Avoid surprises with predicted upcoming expenses

### 5. Anomaly & Fraud Detection
- **Baseline Analysis**: Establishes normal spending per category
- **Real-time Alerts**: Warns when transactions exceed 200% of baseline
- **Severity Levels**: Low, medium, and high severity indicators

## 💬 Usage

### Logging an Expense

**Text Mode:**
```
"Spent $25.50 on lunch at Chipotle"
"Coffee this morning cost $4.50"
"$150 electric bill from PG&E"
```

**Voice Mode:**
1. Tap **Start Recording**
2. Speak naturally: *"I spent forty five dollars on groceries at Safeway"*
3. AI will parse and save automatically

### Asking the Financial Coach

Try questions like:
- "Can I afford a $500 laptop?"
- "How can I reduce my spending?"
- "What are my biggest expenses?"
- "Am I spending too much on food?"
- "How much should I save each month?"

The coach uses your last 30 days of data to provide personalized advice.

## 🤖 Model Configuration

Quantized models optimized for on-device inference:

| Model | Size |
|-------|------|
| LFM2-350M-Q4_K_M (LLM) | ~250 MB |
| Whisper Tiny English (STT) | ~105 MB |
| Piper TTS Lessac Medium (TTS) | ~65 MB |
| Silero VAD v5 | ~5 MB |
| **Total** | **~425 MB** |

> Models are downloaded once and cached in the browser's Origin Private File System (OPFS).

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel
```bash
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```
The included `vercel.json` sets the required Cross-Origin-Isolation headers.

### Netlify
Add a `_headers` file:
```
/*
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
```

### Any Static Host
Serve the `dist/` folder with these HTTP headers on all responses:
```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
```

---

## 🖥 Browser Requirements

- Chrome 96+ or Edge 96+ (recommended: 120+)
- WebAssembly support
- SharedArrayBuffer (requires Cross-Origin Isolation headers)
- OPFS (for persistent model cache)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for smooth operation

### Performance Tips
1. Use Chrome/Edge for **WebGPU acceleration** (10x faster inference)
2. Falls back to WASM if WebGPU is unavailable
3. First-time model download takes ~5 minutes (one-time only)
4. Clearing browser cache will delete stored transaction data

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Models Not Downloading
1. Open DevTools → Application → Storage
2. Clear OPFS (Origin Private File System) data
3. Reload and re-download models

### Slow Performance
1. Use Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+ for WebGPU support
2. Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings
3. Close other tabs to free up memory

### Voice Input Not Working
1. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
2. Ensure VAD + STT models are fully downloaded
3. Test microphone in browser settings

### Database Not Persisting
1. Use normal browsing mode (not incognito)
2. Check browser storage permissions
3. Free up browser storage space

### AI Giving Incorrect Calculations
The LFM2 350M model is not reliable for arithmetic. Always compute totals in your backend/code and pass the result to the model — never let the LLM calculate sums itself.
